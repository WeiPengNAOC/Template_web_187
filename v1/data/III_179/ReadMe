Description:
    Spectra are presented for MK standards in the wavelength range
    580-1020nm. The stars cover the normal spectral types O to M and
    luminosity types I, III, and V. In addition, a small number of
    peculiar stars are included. The data are in 137 FITS files, in
    the "fits" subdirectory.

    The list of the 137 stars is included in the "stars.dat" file;
    note that the list is not identical to the stars listed in Table1
    of the paper.

Introduction:
    The projected slit width along the dispersion was about 4{AA},
    slightly less than 2 pixels. The data are corrected for atmospheric
    extinction. The fluxes are relative; to convert to "absolute" the
    values should be multiplied by 10-13erg/cm2/s/{AA} (10-15W/m2/nm)
    but because not all of the flux was collected by the slit, these
    values will be about 15% low with the factor depending on the seeing.

    Some features in the spectrum have been introduced by the
    instrumentation. The most notable feature is a small emission
    peak near the NaI 5896{AA} absorption line.

    The data are in FITS format. The FITS header does not include the
    units, which are described above.

    The spectral types and luminosity classes given in the published paper
    supersede those given in the FITS headers.

Note on stars.dat: the file contains in addition 7 blank lines which
     separate the spectral types. This list, close to Table 1 of the
     paper, is however not identical: some stars listed in the paper
     are not in the file, and the file contains a few additional stars
     not listed in the paper.

History:
  * The spectra were received at ADC (Paul Kuin) in December 1994.
  * 02-Nov-2003: the file "stars.dat" made from the FITS headers wad added.
    The positions and magnitudes were extracted from SIMBAD, and the spectral
    classes were reported from the Table 1 of the paper.
